    <p>Some things make you old.</p>
    <p>People might say having a regular schedule makes you so. Waking up on time and going about the day's business
    like clockwork, ticking away each passing moment with pinpoint accuracy, marking out portions being well organized
    and responsible. You know you're getting old when most of your conversations start with &quot;Oh, those were the
    days...&quot; or &quot;I remember this used to cost so little back then...&quot;. You know you're old when you
    cannot stand dirty laundry any more, or are no longer too lazy to do the dishes. We've actually been alive for more
    years in the 21st century than the 20th.</p>
    <p>Back when we were young, our years were ever so clearly marked out by the streaming torrent of competitive
    academic and scholarly pursuits. Every year had a clearly defined number of semesters with exams and we were lost in
    the race hopping from one milestone to the next. It was like an audition: a tutorial, for stuff that lay ahead. In
    its nascent stages, human brains tend to be most impressionable and stuff we grasp into ourselves usually tends to
    hold on for long amounts of time. In fact, the smallest of things: an idea, a preference, an idiosyncrasy, can
    actually affect something much more than itself as we grow up. The simplest of things and the smallest of habits
    sometimes cause manifestations which no one might believe to be possible otherwise.</p>
    <p>A funny example comes to mind. In my childhood, I used to absolutely love sticking one end of a strand of Maggi
    noodles in my mouth leaving the other end hanging outside: a long thread of noodle hanging down from the mouth.
    Then, I used to suck on the strand quickly. Consequently, the hanging noodle's length would shorten rapidly and it
    would rush into my mouth dancing around as it went in. Now to ensure that such long strands survived in the final
    product, it was critical that the Maggi units remained unbroken while cooking them. So, I let then boil in water and
    unravel by themselves. While cooking Maggi the other day, I realized that this behavior has become so ingrained in
    me, that it is completely automatic for me not to break the units while cooking even today. This, even though I
    stopped playing with noodle strands long ago. Now imagine the collective entirety of such instances, such small
    preferences and idiosyncrasies. Every single person would have their own set of beliefs and choices that they made
    as children or the environment they grew in, which would shape them into the way they are today. We've read around
    and seen evidences of the often repeated &quot;Man is but a product of his circumstances&quot;. But to grasp the
    full meaning of it requires opening up our mind to the tiny little things that metamorphose into huge portions of a
    person's character. Consider this definition of the word &quot;sonder&quot; from <a
      href="http://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/post/23536922667/sonder">The Dictionary of Obscure
      Sorrows</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Sonder n. the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own &#8211;
      populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness &#8211; an epic story that
      continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands
      of other lives that you'll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in
      the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This "inherited craziness" is something which the tutorial years affect in us. Unfortunately, our brains have not
    matured enough then and so, in a way, most of what we are today has been shaped by events and choices which have not
    been in our control. Now, to go back and take a different path is harder and harder, the more you try to backtrack.
    Instances of such choices are not hard to find.</p>
    <p>The choice of career can be considered one such instance. Most normal people are utterly confused at the time of
    choosing what they want to do with their life, hell they're confused even after getting a degree. Usually, their
    decisions tend to be influenced by peers and parents. The guy who was unsure &#8211; who compromised and made an
    arbitrary decision &#8211; does stand to regret it later if he realizes his true calling and sees that he can't
    backtrack any more, at least not easily. It takes real courage to follow your heart once you've made a proper
    investment along a particular direction. Most won't follow suit. I've had discussions with my parents to this
    effect. What they ended up doing &#8211; what people in general end up doing &#8211; has got a lot more to do with
    circumstance and environment than their own choice. To a man who is the sole support for his family, his existing
    career choice would pay off more than if he were to backtrack and start afresh &#8211; his investments have been
    expensive. On the other hand, to someone already well off, or to someone on whom pressures of family are not too
    great, it might pay just as well to discontinue walking along their existing path and backtrack to take a new one.
    People with huge inheritances, or (assuming a progressive Indian mindset) even women could fall into this category.
    In general, familial pressures tend to fall heavily on the shoulders of the man, and the lady of the house can
    theoretically choose to pursue what she pleases. Of course, this assumes a reasonably idealistic and progressive
    society.  Unfortunately, this is often not the case since even today, the married woman is often required to stay at
    home and leave her aspirations aside. This reflects in popular culture as well, as I shall demonstrate shortly. But
    that is a topic for another time. In any case, it cannot be doubted that backtracking in general is difficult and
    there are few who actually manage it.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br> And sorry I could not travel both<br> And be one traveler, long I
    stood<br> And looked down one as far as I could<br> To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br> <br> Then took the
    other, as just as fair,<br> And having perhaps the better claim,<br> Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
    Though as for that the passing there<br> Had worn them really about the same,<br> <br> And both that morning equally
    lay<br> In leaves no step had trodden black.<br> Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br> Yet knowing how way leads
    on to way,<br> I doubted if I should ever come back.<br> <br> I shall be telling this with a sigh<br> Somewhere ages
    and ages hence:<br> Two roads diverged in a wood, and I &#8211;<br> I took the one less traveled by,<br> And that has made
    all the difference<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.<br></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Is it good then, to take the road less travelled by? Or maybe better to stick to the beaten track? The choice is entirely personal.</p>
    <p>Here is another such instance (which has recently been a rather heated ground for discussion): to believe or not
    to believe in a higher power which directly or indirectly affects life on earth in some way, or an entity which is
    responsible for the creation of mankind as a whole. Opinions on these subjects have been passed down to us from
    generations of ancestors, finally through our parents. At a very young age, we are taught to pray and worship and
    believe that our troubles have an end as there is He who works His magic from above and handles out an equal share
    of happiness for everyone. Would we have believed with so much ardent faith had we been as thoughtful and
    inquisitive then as we are now? In fact, a majority of non-believers across the world agree at least on this: had we
    been as mature then as we are now, or had this theory been proposed to us now instead of then, there would exist a
    significantly less number of believers indeed. Our ancestors would also have questioned this probably. There are so
    many people in the world that an idea is extremely likely to take root in more than one person at a time. Did they
    change their belief then, or did they stand silently and bend to conform? Popular (Indian) culture at least tends to
    provide evidence towards the latter. At least until the final years of the last century, we were continuously fed
    instances of reward from God in return for our good deeds and punishment for sins. Be it the return of the
    proverbial mother's eyesight through dedicated prayers in "Amar, Akbar, Anthony" or the typical "Bhagwaan tumhe
    kabhi maaf nahi karega" (God will never forgive you). Oh and (by the way) these are also the movies which enforce
    the role of the woman as the home maker, which I have touched upon near the end of my previous point regarding
    career. For instance, in Hum Saath Saath Hain, we get this "Jahaan ghar ki ladies aur bacchiyaan hamein apne haathon
    se aur pyaar se khana khilaye, wahi ghar ghar hai" (True home is the place where ladies and daughters of the house
    feed us with their own hands with love)<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
    <p>Digging deeper, I'm sure we would obtain a lot more such instances to reiterate the original point about man
    being a product of circumstances and decisions taken early on, that tend to affect what he is today. Now, sometimes
    we get so lost in the little world we've created for ourselves that we take these things for granted and not
    question them any more. Although, it can be agreed that it would be much simpler to live in blissful ignorance,
    still these things are what make you grow as a person and knowing them will influence your thoughts, opinions and
    would probably shape the way you'll turn out to be, say twenty more years from now.</p>
    <p>One of the best subjects to illustrate this point is something which is omnipresent in the mind of every
    twenty-something's parent out here: marriage. Unlike the last time we delegated our decisions to someone else, this
    time we are in conscious control. This is the kind of decision which would affect the next fifty odd years of our
    life. And our outlook and opinion today would be the seed for what we become fifty years from now, just as our
    childhood has influenced how we are today. Hence, there is a lot of pressure to fulfil our important decisions in
    the most responsible manner possible. I've come across a lot of discussions (on Quora and elsewhere) which bash
    arranged marriages in favour of love marriages. While both sides do have their pros and cons<a href="#fn3"
      class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, things get tricky for the arranged school of thought where
    unfamiliarity with the "better half" for such a long term commitment starts causing jitters. Considering how much
    our subsequent years depend on trust, mutual respect and cooperation (and of course, love) that come with marriage,
    making an informed decision seems imperative and to not simply rush into something just because "society" expects us
    to. The simplest form of an idea today, will be an integral part of our self in the future. It's the flap of a
    butterfly.</p>

    I never used to think so much every time a new year arrived. This time was different for some reason.
    Measuring time used to be so much easier, when things were on tutorial mode and each tick was clearly marked out for
    us with love and care. Now we have to rely on other means to tick through time. What marks an year a year? Have we
    grown as persons in that time? Have we learnt something new? What is it? Watching a life changing movie, reading a
    brilliant book, being involved in an extraordinary project at work, some means of learning, some means of growth, or
    simply a trip around the sun? Everyone makes their measurement using their own tools. Whatever it is that marks our
    years today, we are surely here to stay, and we are not getting any younger.</p>
    <p>The audition is done. The game is on!</p></em></section>
