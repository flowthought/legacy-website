      <p>I'm on a train to Hyderabad. I am sitting on the (side) lower berth
      with my back pressed against the divider between two sections. It is
      around 1 am in the night and I'm peering through the glass. People who
      stop looking out of the window at night because there's nothing to see are
      wrong. I see a new side to the surroundings: a different, quieter side
      which I like. Rocking softly back and forth I see streams of light passing
      by as the train hurtles into the blackness. Abandoned railway platforms,
      roads bathed in soft yellow from streetlights. I see a town I think, or is
      it a city? I see some buildings which have passed me by. It is almost
      definitely a town I think. A town on the outskirts of a city most likely.
      I check the time and remind myself that I am expecting to reach Pune
      around this point.</p>
      <p>It looks like a factory, with a fortress around it. A small patch of
      houses, weak ones with tarpaulin on the roof to protect against the rains
      but won't probably stand any chance in the wind. I see shanties, clobbered
      small roads as the train approaches a bridge overlooking a river — the
      cliché of railway movie escapades. I seem to be slowly coming up on the
      city; the train seems to slow down a bit. Wow, people really love bright
      halogen lamps around here. A red signal blinks red and tries to stop an
      oil tanker which does not stop. The tankers and trucks are the Kings of
      the Night. As the world sleeps, they will awake to life and, ahem,
      freedom. They are the Cockroaches of the Night<a href="#fn1"
        class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. As day comes, they
      will hide somewhere and get the entire night's worth of sleep. They will
      start scurrying when darkness falls again. I know, I empathize.</p>
      <p>I enter a dark area (has the city passed?) and I see light streaming
      out of the train from the window ahead of me. Probably another nyctophile
      there. Or maybe they just forgot to switch off the light, which seems more
      likely. We are few in number in this particular train.</p>
      <p>The dark was a red herring however, and I'm suddenly bang in the middle
      of a station on which this train is mostly going to halt, judging by its
      speed. The words A.C chair car, blaze out at me from the Deccan Queen
      which I can observe parked in the track next to mine. And now the train
      has stopped. I see no platform come up, and so, conclude that this seems
      to be a halt before the actual halt. My recent experiences with the Indian
      Railways, have been pretty lovely. The trains usually love the fact that I
      have boarded them and don't like to see me get off soon. As I result, I've
      reached my destination late by anywhere between three and six hours in the
      past few months. This train promises to be no exception: as soon as I
      boarded it, I was greeted by the ticket invigilator's grim warning.
      Apparently we were going to take a diversion along the way and take a
      longer route, which will take up to two hours more to reach. You see,
      trains love me.</p>
      <p>We've started moving and I see the familiar interweb of railway tracks
      before we reach a major station. Tea vendors are scurrying around the
      platform, waiting in place before they come aboard. I close my curtain to
      save myself from poking and prying eyes that may or may not board the
      train, hoping they leave me in peace. It's been quite a while since I've
      come up with something to write.</p>
      <p>An electronic female voice announces the arival of my train on Pune
      station sorely for the benefit of tea vendors to commence their sales
      pitch towards snoring passengers. Long gone are the days of railway
      platforms which stay quiet in the night. I hear modest bustling around in
      my coach as someone who's made their way in tries to lock their luggage
      with a chain to the bottom of their seat. They are fumbling around with
      it, probably crippled by the absence of light. I peek around my curtain in
      curiosity: they are hidden behind their own curtain, but I see the light
      getting switched on.</p>
      <p>The cool voice announces my ‘superfast’ train's arrival, followed by a
      short note of how it's running late by two hours. If only all voices were as
      polite, apologetic and kind as this electronic one, we probably won't have
      any problems and would live in utopia. Again, that may be a problem in
      itself, so I'm confused<a
        href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. I see a man sitting just outside my window
      fiddling around with his cell phone while plugged into a wall outlet. He
      is probably reading something important.</p>
      <p>The train has started moving and I am mildly thankful that no one seems
      to have arrived to claim the side upper berth above me. I might have a
      free rein over my side of the train to stretch out tomorrow morning<a
        href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> – when I'm
      gonna be late and will most likely reach post lunch time at the office,
      this is going to be my silver lining.</p>
      <p>There are paintings on the walls of this platform. A collection of
      handprints occupying a wall in the background of a blaring “Saare
      jaahaan se accha” catches my eye. I smile to myself as I remember the
      Mangalyaan documentary which I saw yesterday. I wonder how convinced the
      song writer was of the <em>absolute</em> superiority of our nation. Or was
      it just wishful thinking at that point...</p>
      <p>I am kind of regretting giving away my nice upper berth for a side
      lower one as no air reaching me is conditioned enough in this A/C
      compartment<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef"
        id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. I feel perspiration is going to be a bit
      of a problem. Aah well, at least I get my window and the scene keeps
      changing before me: better than what they show on cable TV anyway.</p>
      <p>The train has left the station and gathered speed now. All those city
      houses and buildings are gone behind me and I see outskirts again. Small
      clusters of houses with small porches and even smaller lamps. They seem to
      be getting more and more sparse now. The train is superfast. Very soon the
      only thing I can see ouside are pinpricks of white light and the
      reflection of my own laptop screen on the window. I try to peer into the
      darkness and see an isolated light in the distance. I wonder what it is.
      Some old shack in which someone might be sleeping at this hour. They don't
      know that I'm writing about them. They will simply get up in the morning
      and go around business as usual.</p>
      <p>I open the curtain to try to get some cool air. I should probably be
      sleeping but I feel awake as I always do when my circadian rhythm has
      adapted itself differently. I see something called “Tej
      Platinum” making its presence felt in big blue neon signs out in the
      night. I wonder if the presence being made felt is so necessary this late
      at night: especially with a name which gives away precious little about
      the business (I highly doubt that there is a shop selling platinum in the
      middle of nowhere). The mind of someone who codes for a living falls prey
      to the occupational hazard of making ridiculous pet peeves out of
      inefficient expression of information. This coming from someone who's
      written a thousand words out of practically nothing may be a bit of
      hypocrisy, since it's probably still less than what a picture would have
      said. I do not want to be this hypocrite, and so I will shed a bit of
      modesty by saying that to me at least, a thousand words like these are
      better than a picture anyway.</p>
      <p>A picture you see, has to be observed correctly for it to equal a
      thousand words in any way. With so many pictures taken by smart phone
      cameras around the world today being selfies<a href="#fn5"
        class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, I wonder if this is
      true. Maybe if you sit in front of it and try to come up with things you
      don't see or which you wished you saw, or have convinced yourself that you
      are seeing, maybe then, you can come up with a thousand words which are no
      equal to your visual representation. But then, with the flood of pictures
      in the Cloud today, of varied versions of duckfaces and self indulgences,
      I repeatedly keep questioning this old saying.</p>
      <p>I was sitting in a restaurant in Hyderabad waiting for my food when an
      old man and (presumably) his daughter came in and sat at the table beside
      me. They looked at the menu, and said not a word to one another. The
      waiter came by and each of them gave their separate order. The girl
      received an important message on her phone which she started reading with
      great focus. Her father looked at the menu card, probably thinking over
      what to get next. He saw the glass of water and drank a sip. Shortly
      afterwards, the waiter brought over their food and they ate in silence.
      The girl probably talked once to her father to clarify on something he was
      thinking of ordering. They finished eating and left. Beside them were a
      family of four, with two children fiddling around on (a) a smart phone
      taking pictures and (b) an iPad, while the irate father yelled at the
      waiter for messing up their order and the mother was casting furtive
      distrustful glances at the creepy bearded dude two tables away who was
      eating alone and watching her children do important stuff on nice 16
      million color screens.</p>
      <p>I check my word count in the sweet vim-airline status bar and see that
      I have crossed a thousand five hundred. I mentally high five myself and
      look out the window again.</p>
