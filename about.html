        <blockquote>
          I found that I tend at times, to hook upon a particular thought, incident or
          memory involuntarily, and analyse it to the extent of going into a trance. When
          people started bringing me back to reality by poking and prodding, I realized
          that my thoughts straying constantly without boundary need to be reined in,
          organized and assimilated to keep snapshots for the record. I observe, analyse
          and in course of time, observe myself doing the analysis — in effect paralysing
          the outcome.

        <p>Wow, I never thought writing an about page would be this hard. It really makes for some serious
        introspection.</p>
        <p>I am a computer science major currently living in Hyderabad, India and working for Microsoft. I started
        writing on a Wordpress blog two years ago, but didn't like the lack of control over presentation. I couldn't
        bring myself to write content consistently because I never liked the limitations of what I could do in
        presentation (at least that's what I like to tell myself, I'm totally not lazy or anything).  Anyway, I was
        introduced to this static site generator called Hugo, which gave me hope of creating the perfect blogging
        experience. Due to reasons, which I hope to mention in a proper article, within a month I was disliking it
        again, and I realized that what I wanted could only be found by starting from the basics.</p>
        <p>I have never done front end web development before, but once I started learning CSS, I knew I had finally
        found the tool I was looking for. I came up with this site after about three months of tinkering around, and I
        liked what I came up with. So I'm finally publishing it, custom domain name and everything, under the beauty
        that is <a href='https://github.com/flowthought/flowthought.github.io.git'>Github Pages</a>. This site is still
        under development - the awesome new features of CSS3 are calling out to me and I expect that I'll be using this
        site as a playground for them in the coming months. As of now though, I believe this simple layout based on
        Ethan Schoonover's gorgeous <a href='http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized'>solarized palette</a> is sufficient
        for me. But do expect things to change from time to time.</p>
        <p>I am a dabbler of sorts - I keep getting interested in a lot of things and like to try them out. I play the
        piano a bit and have a few of my recordings on <a href='https://soundcloud.com/kalpak-tapas'>Soundcloud</a>.  I
        am passionate about reading and try to read as much as possible. I do expect to post book reviews every now and
        then. I am also a fan of the Arch Linux philosophy of simplicity. Needless to say, it is my favorite Linux
        distro and I live and breathe in it. I love working with the keyboard and mostly on the command line. Vim is my
        editor of choice and ever since I began using it, my laziness of writing has drastically reduced. I've never
        had so much fun while typing. I have a Macbook Air from 2014 which serves as a portable piece of myself and an
        Android phone. My desktop has Windows alongside the aforementioned Arch Linux (yes, I am a technophile).</p>
        <p>I use Windows quite frequently too. It is a major part of my work in Microsoft and it lends itself very
        easily to gaming - which is another interest of mine. Collectible card games are currently a thing and I used to
        be a big fan of Hearthstone. I still play it from time to time, but it's becoming more and more of a gamble to
        obtain decent cards even if you pay for them. Hence I've laid back into the simpler, free to play life. The
        Witcher 3 was a huge revelation to me with regard to storytelling and immersive experiences.  I still have to
        finish it, but it completely blew me away. I like strategy/simulation games like the Civilization series and
        Kerbal Space Program.  Civilization V is the only game I've actually played, since I've only recently built a
        decent gaming rig.  Kerbal Space Program is a whole different ballpark.  The feel of looking at the blue earth
        in sky from the rocky surface of the moon where you reached after long hours of building, launching and landing
        a spaceship built from scratch, is extremely humbling.</p>
        <p>I hope to write more regularly from now on, about all my experiences and dabblings. All content on this site

        at means to integrate a commenting system like Disqus for articles on this blog soon.</p>
        <p>That's about it for now. I'll be updating this spot as and when I learn new things about the world and
        myself. Thanks for reading, and hope you enjoy the content.</p>
